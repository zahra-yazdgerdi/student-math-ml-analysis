# Students-Performance-
A complete machine learning pipeline for analyzing student academic performance using the student-mat.csv dataset. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, classification models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM), and visual analytics like heatmaps and feature importance plots. Designed for educational data research and EdTech projects.
# Educational Data Analysis with Machine Learning

This project uses the `student-mat.csv` dataset to explore student performance using machine learning techniques.

## üîç Objectives:
- Preprocess and encode educational data
- Classify final grade into good, fair, poor
- Apply ML models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
- Visualize feature importance and correlation

## üìä Tools:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Classification metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Heatmap analysis
- Feature importance plots

## üß† Future Work:
- Extend analysis to TIMSS / PIRLS
- Integrate adaptive feedback logic
- Exportable model for real-time scoring
